# RaspiPlex

RaspiPlex is a project grown from heating the pool with vacuum tubes to a house management system with a few IoT elements. The project started in 2012 with some temperature measurements, then pumps and valves were connected and each year more stuff is attached to the RaspiPlex project. An internal website is providing visual information.

We (Wim and I) started this project as an experiment to see how far we could get with rudimentary knowledge of solarpower, Python and RaspberryPi to heat the pool. It went above expectations. So we connected the pottery workshop to the collector and a year later the central heating of the house. From there on we started to connect everything we could think of to the raspberry pi's (nodes). 

This is a project in progress. By sharing our material we hope people will learn with or teach us. Parts starting with a prefix like PL (pool), LM (house), CV (central) and SF (solar farm) are stable and in 'production'. Other parts are supporting scripts.

note:
rename config_hms copy.py to config_hms.py, you will need config_hms.py and bieb.py to run any of the prefixed scripts.
